Java image processing

[Shapelogic Java](http://shapelogic.org) is an image processing library focused on bring functional programming methods to Java.
It works stand alone and as a plugin to ImageJ.

It was written from 2007 to 2009.
Currently it is using libraries that are no longer available.

Both Java 8 and Scala has much better functional programming machinery than Shapelogic Java, 
so continuing this work does not make sense.

Work has started on a newer version [Shapelogic Scala](https://github.com/sami-badawi/shapelogic)
This is porting some working image processing algorithms from Shapelogic Java.
